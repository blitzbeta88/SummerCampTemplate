# SummerCampTemplate

This code is intended to be used as a template for the Roll Over game at both the Lakewood High 
and Palm Harbor High 2024 Advanced Robotics Summer Camps. This code will provide you with all of
the essential code that you will need for Autonomous and TeleOp; however, you will need to
adjust values to make it work with your robot.

Have fun and good luck!
